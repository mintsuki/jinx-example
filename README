Example Jinx distribution
=========================

Directories and meaning:

build-support: This is not a Jinx specific name, it's just used for extra files.
host-recipes: Recipes for packages that will be ran on the host inside the containerised environment.
patches: Patches that will be applied to the fetched sources.
recipes: Recipes for packages that will be cross compiled for the target OS.
source-recipes: Recipes for source-specific fetch information and regeneration.

If jinx is in $PATH, run "jinx build-all" to build all target recipes (and their host dependencies).
